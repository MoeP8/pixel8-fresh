## Test Suite 2: Service Worker Functionality

### 2.1 Service Worker Registration
**Manual Tests:**
1. [ ] Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
2. [ ] Verify service worker is registered and active
3. [ ] Check scope is set to `/`
4. [ ] No registration errors in console

**Automated Check:**
```javascript
// Browser console test
navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(registration => {
  console.log('SW registered:', registration.scope);
  console.log('SW active:', registration.active?.state);
});
```

### 2.2 Caching Strategy Tests

#### Static Assets Caching
1. [ ] Load app → Check DevTools Network tab
2. [ ] Refresh page → Verify assets served from cache
3. [ ] Check cache storage in DevTools → Application → Storage

#### API Caching (Network-First)
1. [ ] Make API calls → Verify cached in storage
2. [ ] Go offline → Check cached responses served
3. [ ] Return online → Verify cache updates

#### Route Caching (Stale-While-Revalidate)
1. [ ] Navigate between pages while online
2. [ ] Go offline → Test navigation still works
3. [ ] Check cached HTML responses

### 2.3 Offline Functionality
1. [ ] Load app while online
2. [ ] Toggle offline in DevTools → Network → Offline
3. [ ] Navigate app → Verify core functionality works
4. [ ] Check offline fallback page loads correctly
5. [ ] Return online → Verify sync functionality
