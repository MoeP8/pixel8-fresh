## Step 1: Vercel Authentication

Since Vercel CLI is installed, authenticate with your account:

```bash
vercel login
```

**Choose your preferred login method:**
- Continue with GitHub (recommended)
- Continue with Google
- Continue with Email

**After authentication**, you'll see:
```
> Success! GitHub account (your-username) added to your user.
```

---

## Step 2: Initial Deployment

Deploy the PWA to Vercel:

```bash
vercel --prod --yes
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🔗  Linked to your-username/pixel8-fresh
🔍  Inspect: https://vercel.com/your-username/pixel8-fresh/deployments/[id]
✅  Production: https://pixel8-fresh-[hash].vercel.app
```

**Copy the production URL** - this is your temporary deployment URL.

---

## Step 3: Verify PWA Deployment

Test the deployed PWA:

1. **Open the Vercel URL** in Chrome
2. **Check PWA Features:**
   - [ ] Service worker registers (DevTools → Application → Service Workers)
   - [ ] Manifest accessible at `/manifest.json`
   - [ ] Icons load properly at `/icons/icon-192x192.svg`
   - [ ] Install prompt appears (wait 10 seconds)
   - [ ] App installs successfully

3. **Test Mobile:**
   - [ ] Open on mobile device
   - [ ] "Add to Home Screen" works
   - [ ] App launches in standalone mode

---

## Step 4: Custom Domain Configuration

### Option A: Via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Access Dashboard**:
   - Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Select your `pixel8-fresh` project

2. **Add Domain**:
   - Navigate to **Settings** → **Domains**
   - Click **Add Domain**
   - Enter your domain: `pixel8.com` (replace with your domain)
   - Click **Add**

3. **DNS Configuration**:
   Vercel will show you the required DNS records:

   **For Apex Domain (pixel8.com):**
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 76.76.19.61
   TTL: 3600
   ```

   **For WWW Subdomain (www.pixel8.com):**
   ```
   Type: CNAME  
   Name: www
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   TTL: 3600
   ```

### Option B: Via CLI

```bash
# Add your custom domain
vercel domains add pixel8.com

# Check domain status
vercel domains ls
```

---

## Step 5: DNS Provider Setup

Update your DNS records with your domain provider:

### Popular Providers:

**Cloudflare:**
1. Go to DNS management
2. Add A record: `@` → `76.76.19.61`
3. Add CNAME record: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`

**GoDaddy:**
1. Go to DNS Management
2. Add A record with Host `@` and Points to `76.76.19.61`
3. Add CNAME record with Host `www` and Points to `cname.vercel-dns.com`

**Namecheap:**
1. Go to Advanced DNS
2. Add A Record: Host `@`, Value `76.76.19.61`
3. Add CNAME Record: Host `www`, Value `cname.vercel-dns.com`

---

## Step 6: SSL Certificate & Propagation

1. **Wait for DNS Propagation**: 5 minutes to 24 hours (usually 15-30 minutes)

2. **Check Propagation**:
   ```bash
   # Check DNS propagation
   nslookup pixel8.com
   dig pixel8.com
   ```

3. **SSL Auto-Provisioning**: Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt

4. **Verify HTTPS**: 
   - Visit `https://pixel8.com`
   - Check for valid SSL certificate (green lock icon)

---

## Step 7: Post-Deployment Validation

### PWA Functionality Test

Run our automated validation on production:

```bash
# Update the base URL in validate-pwa.js to your domain
# Then run validation
node scripts/validate-pwa.js
```

### Manual Validation Checklist

## Step 8: Environment Variables (If Needed)

If your app uses environment variables:

```bash
# Set production environment variables
vercel env add VITE_SUPABASE_URL production
vercel env add VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY production
vercel env add VITE_APP_ENV production
```

Or via Vercel Dashboard:
- Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
