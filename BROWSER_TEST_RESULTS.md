# Browser JavaScript Test Results

## Test Setup
- Added alert() test to index.html
- Should show alert dialog if JavaScript works
- Should replace loading screen with red error message

## Expected Results
1. Alert dialog appears immediately when page loads
2. Loading screen replaced with "JAVASCRIPT IS WORKING" message
3. Console shows "ðŸ§ª CONSOLE TEST: JavaScript executing"

## Instructions for Manual Testing
1. Open http://localhost:8080 in Chrome
2. Check if alert dialog appears
3. Check if page content changes from loading screen
4. Open Developer Tools > Console
5. Look for console messages

## If Alert Appears:
- JavaScript execution is working
- Issue is in React/TypeScript compilation or imports
- Proceed to test React imports specifically

## If No Alert:
- JavaScript execution is blocked
- Check browser console for CSP violations
- Check browser security settings
- Check browser extensions blocking JavaScript

## Next Steps Based on Results
- Record findings in this file
- Determine if issue is JavaScript blocking or React-specific
